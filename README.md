# Longcat? WTF!

This is a WTF!? website coded for the lulz during a private two-day hackathon **including** some sleep.

What this means is that the code is totally not indicative of our skills and nothing you can learn from.
The only thing we cared about was getting our vision done.
Maintenance? What are you talking about?

Live prosper and loooooong!
